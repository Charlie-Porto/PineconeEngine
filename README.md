# Pinecone Engine
a three-unit library for 3D graphics and games (and my introduction to library authoring)
- unit 1: SDL2 event loop wrapper 
- unit 2: entity component system 
- unit 3: 3D rendering tools
<br/>


## Requirements
- C++17 compiler (any should work)
- The [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) and [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) libraries will need to be obtained and built separately. Fortunately, the SDL library contains robust build instructions, and the glm library is header-only.
